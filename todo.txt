- add conditions so that piercing and bouncing are mutually exclusive - act like unlockables? 
- Add on-hit unlock for bouncing, since piercing gets laser
- more enemy mutations, more enemy types
- more upgrades: homing, size (bullet and player)
- 1-off upgrades, e.g. path editors, acceleration curves, styles, etc. 
- upgrade trees: when you hit 0 hp, you unlock powerful lich upgrades, change character sprite
- need new sprites for enemies and the player, while we're on that



- rocks maybe scale in health faster so that they can pierce through massive damage builds, dodging should always be preferred with rocks
- When getting a mutation, show the name
- poisoned enemies leave poison trail

- something is fucked with lightning, it's hitting the same enemy multiple times
- bombers are still dropping bombs after death



Ideas:
- Enemies should drop money based on their health, not droprate
- You don't pay for upgrades, you pay for everything else (rerolls, more upgrade slots, guaranteed legendary, )
- Upgrade that rewards the player whenever a mob dies from anything other than a direct hit (venom, lightning, etc)
- Plague explosion should have a more generic "mob explode on death" unlockable as a prerequisite
- Make delving more expensive, so it's very difficult to hit the first one, but also have some way to gain money
- Achievements! e.g. "Win a round with Plague after only firing once"
- An unlock for piercing that rewards hitting multiple enemies with one shot, e.g. on three hits in the first second of firing
- Skipping unlockable increases money cap or something (DONE)

- Unlock that makes you deal more damage based on how much money you have

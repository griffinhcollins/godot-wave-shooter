- add conditions so that piercing and bouncing are mutually exclusive - act like unlockables? 
- Add on-hit unlock for bouncing, since piercing gets laser
- more enemy mutations, more enemy types
- more upgrades: homing, size (bullet and player)
- 1-off upgrades, e.g. path editors, acceleration curves, styles, etc. 
- upgrade trees: when you hit 0 hp, you unlock powerful lich upgrades, change character sprite
- need new sprites for enemies and the player, while we're on that


Ideas:
- Enemies should drop money based on their health, not droprate
